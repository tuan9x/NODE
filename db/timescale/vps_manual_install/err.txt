* Er: FATAL:  extension "timescaledb" must be preloaded (When after select db, then run create EXTENSION):
  + sudo -u postgres psql
  + \c meone
  + SET timescaledb.allow_install_without_preload = 'on';
  => Connect db and set "allow_install_without_preload"


  + sudo service postgresql restart
  + sudo service postgresql enable
  => Reload All



==============================> LOG ERR AND SUGGEST: 
FATAL:  extension "timescaledb" must be preloaded
HINT:  Please preload the timescaledb library via shared_preload_libraries.

This can be done by editing the config file at: /etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf
and adding 'timescaledb' to the list in the shared_preload_libraries config.
	# Modify postgresql.conf:
	shared_preload_libraries = 'timescaledb'

Another way to do this, if not preloading other libraries, is with the command:
	echo "shared_preload_libraries = 'timescaledb'" >> /etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf 

(Will require a database restart.)

If you REALLY know what you are doing and would like to load the library without preloading, you can disable this check with: 
	SET timescaledb.allow_install_without_preload = 'on';
server closed the connection unexpectedly
	This probably means the server terminated abnormally
	before or while processing the request.
The connection to the server was lost. Attempting reset: Succeeded.
